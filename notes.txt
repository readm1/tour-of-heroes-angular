Create a new project

    Set up your environment
        Requires node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
        Install angular CLI 
            |=> `npm install -g @angular/cli`
        Create a workshop and initial app
            |=> `ng new <app-name>`

    Serve the application
        In the workspace directory, run the following from the command line
            `ng serve --open`
        `ng serve` => builds the app, starts the dev server, watches the source files and rebuilds the app as you change those files
        `--open` => opens a browser at http://localhost:4200/

    Components are the building blocks of an Angular app. They display data and listen for/respond to user input
        Components are stored in src/app
        The application shell is controlled by the component `AppComponent`, which is broken down in to three files:
            app.component.ts (class code, written in TypeScript)
            app.component.html (component template, written in HTML)
            app.component.css (private CSS styles)
